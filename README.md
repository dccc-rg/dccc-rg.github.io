## A Game of Love for Women: Social Support in Otome Game Mr. Love: Queen’s Choice in China

Otome games (also known as romantic video games, or RVGs) are story-based video games that are designed for young women, simulating the experience of a romantic relationship. Players are invited to adopt the female avatar’s perspective in the story and date one or more of the male characters. Our empirical study focuses on the different types of social support among the players of the Chinese otome game Mr. Love: Queen’s Choice. We discovered that although the game was initially designed to be a consumer product aiming to
profit from a largely marginalized and stigmatized group of gamers, i.e., young female gamers, the game has created a gaming community in which the players seek and provide each other with social support. We primarily use ethnographic methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews. Our study contributes to HCI research on mediated social support in game.

## Building Digital Feminist Counterpublics: Community Moderators And the Everyday Politics in Douban Women-Only Groups


This study explores the intersection of feminist counterpublics and content moderation practices. It adopts qualitative methods to examine the work of volunteer moderators in online women-only communities on Douban, one of the most popular social media sites in China. Female users have built groups for women in a specific profession to exchange information and seek support; others are for women to discuss hobbies such as gaming and literary writing. By investigating the daily work of volunteer moderators in these groups, the paper argues that the moderators in the women-only communities have managed to provide their members with valuable feminist counterpublics. Through sharing personal experience and discussing seemingly banal topics, the moderators have created a space where group members can engage in everyday politics by participating in counternarratives to address gender inequalities prevalent in society.

## Exploring the Ethical Dilemmas of Generative AI in Chinese Cyberspace: A Case Study of the “Cyber 10” Online Community

This study examines grassroots Chinese Internet users' perspective on the ethical implications of generative AI from a sociological standpoint by analyzing opinions expressed in the “Cyber 10 Certification Station” online community on Weibo - a popular Chinese social media platform. “10” is a homophone of “corpse,” symbolic of feeding the corpse of artistic work to generative AI systems. Our thematic analysis and content analysis of the best posts of the community reveal several primary concerns surrounding generative AI, including copyright infringement, privacy issues, fake news, utilization in pornography, and potential threats to creatives' livelihood. This research adds valuable insights into the underrepresented viewpoints of Chinese practitioners and users regarding AI ethics within the CSCW community.

## Identity Struggles as Online Activism in China: A Case Study Based on “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives” Community on Douban

Online communities support the well-being of their members by encouraging their social identity formation. In the context of an online community, online activism in the form of identity struggles can be particularly helpful for marginalized individuals or groups. Since May 2020, students from the 985 universities, an elite educational project in China, have been coming to an online community named “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives” on Douban, an interest-based Social Network Site (SNS), to discuss their failure and dissatisfaction in life. Students who were once recognized for their academic excellence now identify as “fives” (or “garbage”).
The present study examines how the Douban group, as a social network and collaborative system, supports the group members in their identity struggles in the context of increasingly fierce peer competition in China. We employ a qualitative approach, combining ethnographic methods such as participant observation and semi-structured interviews, with in-depth analysis of the top discussion threads. We discover that while peer competition and social stratification in contemporary China cause students at the top universities to feel anxious and lost, the online community they build collectively supports them to create a new social identity, the identity of “five,” which is the basis of their online activism. Through this new identity, they seek unofficial democracy, civic participation, and possibilities of social change.
