## Project 1: The Construction and Organization of a Subculture Digital Community in China: A Case Study Based on “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives”  

This research aims to examine the construction of an online community in China called “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives.” It is a virtual community set up on 10 May, 2020 on Douban. Douban is a Chinese platform where users can rate and review films, books, and music, as well as set up diverse interest groups. "The inviting plan for 985 fives" is a community where 985 university students or graduates share their learning and work failure experiences. In this research, we focus on this particular community, and will lead to in-depth understanding of this digital community, particularly its construction. Understanding particular community is of broader importance to understanding of the social mechanisms of online communities in China, contributing to the field of Media and Communication Studies.

## Project 2: Investigating Public Expectations of the Nation State in a Digital Age: A Case Study of the Online Discourses and Counter-Discourses on the CYLC’s Virtual Idols 

This study aims to explore forms, reasons, and implications of the counter-official discourses on the Communist Youth League of China’s (CYLC) virtual idols on Weibo in the period of February-March 2020. Specifically, it aims to investigate: How individual netizens grapple with and publicly display their relationship with the CYLC, which is generally regarded by the Chinese public as a representative of the nation state; Whether the Chinese netizens’ projection of patriarchal values onto the nation state is responsible for their gendered discourses on the virtual idols; Why the CYLC’s introduction of fandom into political communication has failed to meet public expectations in this specific case, and whether this failure implies a change in the Chinese public’s perception of the nation state. This research not only provides insight into the Chinese public’s understanding and expectations of the nation state, but also unveils how digital media enables the individual to negotiate his or her relationship with the nation state in unprecedented ways. 

*CYLC: Communist Youth League of China
*Jiangshanjiao and Hongqiman (江山嬌與紅旗漫 in Chinese): two virtual idols launched by the CYLC on Weibo in February, 2020. The authority deleted all of the posts related to these two virtual idols five hours after their official launch.
