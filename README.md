## Identity Struggles as Online Activism in China: A Case Study Based on “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives” Community on Douban

Online communities support the well-being of their members by encouraging their social identity formation. In the context of an online community, online activism in the form of identity struggles can be particularly helpful for marginalized individuals or groups. Since May 2020, students from the 985 universities, an elite educational project in China, have been coming to an online community named “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives” on Douban, an interest-based Social Network Site (SNS), to discuss their failure and dissatisfaction in life. Students who were once recognized for their academic excellence now identify as “fives” (or “garbage”). The present study examines how the Douban group, as a social network and collaborative system, supports the group members in their identity struggles in the context of increasingly fierce peer competition in China. We employ a qualitative approach, combining ethnographic methods such as participant observation and semi-structured interviews, with in-depth analysis of the top discussion threads. We discover that while peer competition and social stratification in contemporary China cause students at the top universities to feel anxious and lost, the online community they built collectively supports them to create a new social identity, the identity of “five,” which is the basis of their online activism. Through this new identity, they seek unofficial democracy, civic participation, and possibilities of social change.

## “We Are Citizens, Not Fans!”: A Case Study of Online Political Discourse During the Early COVID-19 Crisis in China

In February 2020, The Communist Youth League of China (CYLC) launched two virtual idols, Jiangshanjiao and Hongqiman, on Weibo, one of the most widely used social media platforms in China, in an attempt to incorporate fandom culture into political communication. Amidst widespread discontent with the management of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, such misuse of fandom culture triggered a backlash among the Chinese netizens. Many netizens refuted idolization of political actors by protesting “We are citizens, not fans!” This study uses Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the political discourse based on the hashtag #JiangshanjiaoandHongqiman#. Rather than adopting the framework of control and resistance prevalent in Chinese Internet research, our study focuses on the netizens’ inconsistent ideas and concepts in their counter-discourse. We find that while the netizens’ fervent protest was successful in forcing the removal of the virtual idols, their political discontent was paradoxically accompanied by strong nationalist sentiment. Moreover, their savvy use of fandom language is contradictory to their objection to the use of fandom culture in the political domain. This article contributes to the literature on online activism by shedding light on the complexity and ambivalence of online political discourse in the Chinese context.

## Building Feminist Safe Spaces: Moderation Practices as Boundary Setting in Douban Feminist Groups

While social media scholars have widely acknowledged that individualized discourses have the potential to promote feminist agendas on social media platforms, few have looked at moderators of online communities, especially in a Chinese context where feminist voices are curtailed by ubiquitous censorship in cyberspace. Drawing upon Gamson’s framework of collective identity (1997), this study investigates how volunteer moderators of online feminist communities on Douban, one of the most popular social media sites in China, contribute to collective identity construction and boundary negotiation of their communities.

The abstract of this project is accepted by International Communication Association 2023 conference.

# Project 4

## Otome Games in China

Otome games are story-based video games that are mainly designed for young women, allowing them to develop a romantic relationship with one of the lead male characters. The term “otome,” which is an archaic term in Japanese for “unmarried young girls,” has been adopted to describe a new genre of games that targets young girls (Andlauer, 2018, p. 166). The Otome game studied in this research, Mr Love: Queen's Choice, is a mobile game first launched on December 14, 2017, by a Chinese mobile game company, mainly targeting young female players in China. The player adopts the perspective of a female avatar. While going through the designed storyline, the player is also asked to choose one or multiple romantic partners among four male leads and develop a relationship with him/them. The fact that the player can choose more than one romantic partner by dating different love interests at the same time makes Otome games also “a space to question the gender identities built into our society” (Andlauer, 2018, p.166). This study examines how the Otome game, Mr Love: Queen's Choice, provides a safe space for players to freely explore romantic connections outside of gender norms and expectations set by Chinese society. More specifically, this study emphasizes how this safe space functions as a social space for young people where they provide each other with both emotional and social support in an unconventional “imagined community” founded on shared romantic experiences and shared romantic partners, and mediated by networked technologies (Anderson, 2006).
