# The Construction and Organization of a Subculture Digital Community in China -- A Case Study Based on “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives”  

This research aims to examine the construction of an online community in China called “The Inviting Plan for 985 Fives.” It is a virtual community set up on 10 May, 2020 on Douban. Douban is a Chinese platform where users can rate and review films, books, and music, as well as set up diverse interest groups. "The inviting plan for 985 fives" is a community where 985 university students or graduates share their learning and work failure experiences. In this research, we focus on this particular community, and will lead to in-depth understanding of this digital community, particularly its construction. Understanding particular community is of broader importance to understanding of the social mechanisms of online communities in China, contributing to the field of Media and Communication Studies.
